## Overview

The Word Document MCP Server provides a bridge between AI assistants and Microsoft Word documents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It exposes Word document operations as tools and resources, allowing AI assistants to directly create, modify, and analyze Word documents.

## Getting Started

For most users, the [Agent Guide](agent_guide.md) is the best place to start. It provides comprehensive instructions on how to interact with the server and perform common operations.

## For Developers

Developers looking to understand or modify the system should refer to the [Architecture Documentation](Architecture.md) and [Architecture Optimization](ARCHITECTURE_OPTIMIZATION.md) documents which explain the system design and implementation details.

## Deployment

For deployment instructions, see the main [Deployment Guide](../DEPLOYMENT.md) in the root directory.
